library(googleAnalyticsR)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(reactable)
library(stringr)

## First, authenticate with our client OAUTH credentials from step 5 of the blog post.
googleAuthR::gar_set_client(json = "secrets/oauth-account-key.json")

## Now, provide the service account email and private key
ga_auth(email = "ga-analysis@test-project-291617.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
        json_file = "secrets/service-account-key.json")

## At this point, we should be properly authenticated and ready to go. We can test this
## by getting a list of all the accounts that this test project has access to. Typically,
## this will be only one if you've created your own service key. If it isn't your only
## account, select the appropriate viewId from your list of accounts.

my_accounts <- ga_account_list()
my_id <- my_accounts$viewId     ## Modify this if you have more than one account

## Let's look at all the visitors to our site. This segment is one of several provided
## by Google Analytics by default.

all_users <- segment_ga4("AllTraffic", segment_id = "gaid::-1")

## Let's look at just one day.

ga_start_date <- today()
ga_end_date <- today()

## Make the request to GA
data_fetch <- google_analytics(my_id,
                               segments = all_users,
                               date_range = c(ga_start_date, ga_end_date),
                               metrics = c("pageviews"),
                               dimensions = c("landingPagePath"),
                               anti_sample = TRUE)

## Let's just create a table of the most viewed posts

most_viewed_posts <- data_fetch %>% 
  mutate(Path = str_trunc(landingPagePath, width=40)) %>% 
  count(Path, wt=pageviews, sort=TRUE)
head(most_viewed_posts, n=5)
```
