# A Flexdashboard for Blog with Google Analytics

This is a supporting repository for a blog.rstudio.com blog post about building a flexdashboard for Google Analytics. 

Code for Part 1 of that blog series is in the Part1/ folder. You will have to provide your own Google Analytics credentials for the code in that folder to work.

Code for Part 2 of the series is in the Part2/ folder. That code uses synthetic Google Analytics data and should be easily reproducible.

Code for Part 3 will be in the Part3/ folder when part 3 of the series is published.
